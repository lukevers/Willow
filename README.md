# Willow

A Responsive theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Willow is really just a fork of the [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) theme, tweaked to the way I want it to be. 

### NOTE

I've added some custom things that are specific to my site. If anyone wants to use this theme, they'll probably want to change a few things, and that's perfectly fine. I don't think the world wants to have my btc tip address on their blog..but you never know!

## Contributing

If you see something that bothers you, or have an idea that would make Willow better, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request! All are welcome, and I encourage them!
